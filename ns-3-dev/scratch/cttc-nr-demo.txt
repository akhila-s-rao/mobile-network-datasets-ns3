Deployment topology: Grid using the GridScenarioHelper. Seems like the gNBs are in one row. But the scenarioHEight and SetVerticalBsDistance does not make sense...   



 
Channel model: 3GPP channel model from TR 38.90. StreeCanyon propagation model with 0 update period and no shadowing.  



Spectrum: 2 bands with one component carrier (cc) each. So 2 BandWidthParts (bwp) each having different subband numerologies.
 

Beamforming: Direct path ideal beamforming.


Core: 0 core latency



Antennas: UEs have 2X4 antenna isotropic elements. gNBs have 4X8 isotropic elements.
