/**
 * \ingroup ue-mac
 * \brief The MAC class for the UE
 *
 * \section ue_mac_general General information
 *
 * The UE MAC has not much freedom, as it is directed by the GNB at which it
 * is attached to. For the attachment phase, we follow (more or less) what is
 * happening in LENA. After the UE is attached, the things become different.
 *
 * \section ue_mac_sr Scheduling Request
 *
 * When a RLC (please remember, there are as many RLC as many bearer the UE has)
 * tells the UE that there is some data in its queue, the UE MAC activates the
 * SR state machine. So, the UE sends a control message (called Scheduling Request)
 * to the PHY, that in turn has to deliver it to the GNB. This message says that
 * the UE has some data to transmit (without indicating the precise quantity).
 *
 * The GNB then allocates some data (a quantity that is implementation-defined)
 * to the UE, in which it can transmit data and a SHORT_BSR.
 *
 * \section ue_mac_response_to_dci Response to a DCI
 *
 * When the UE receives an UL_DCI, it can use a part of it to send a Control Element.
 * The most used control element (and, by the way, the only we support right now)
 * is SHORT_BSR, in which the UE informs the GNB of its buffer status. The rest
 * of the bytes can be used to send data.
 *
 * In the standard, the UE is allowed to send a single PDU in response to a
 * single UL DCI. Such PDU can be formed by one or more subPDU, each one consisting
 * in a header and a data (the data is optional). However, due to limitations in
 * serialization/deserialization of packets in the ns-3 simulator, we are bending
 * a little the definition. The MAC is allowed to send as many PDU as it wants,
 * but these PDU (that are, in fact, packets) should be enqueued in the PHY at
 * the same frame/subframe/slot/symbol. The PHY will use the concept of `PacketBurst`
 * to consider all these PDUs as a single, big, PDU. Practically speaking, the
 * result is the same as grouping these subPDU in a single PDU, just that the
 * single PDU is in reality a PacketBurst. As the order in a PacketBurst cannot
 * be maintained, it is impossible to respect the standard at the ordering part
 * (DL and UL PDU are formed in an opposite way, with CE at the beginning or
 * at the end of the PDU).
 *
 * The action of sending a subPDU to the PHY is done by the method DoTransmitPdu().
 * However, the MAC has to evaluate the received TBS, in light of how many
 * Logical Channel ID are active, and what data they have to transmit. In doing
 * all this, the MAC has to keep in consideration that each subPDU will have
 * a header prefixed, which is an overhead, using bytes that were originally
 * supposed to be assigned to data.
 *
 * The core of this small "scheduling" is done in method SendNewData(), in which
 * the MAC will try to send as many status-subPDUs as possible, then will try
 * to send as many as retx-subPDUs as possible, and finally as many as tx-subPDUs
 * as possible. At the end of all the subPDUs, it will be sent a SHORT_BSR, to
 * indicate to the GNB the new status of the RLC queues. As the SHORT_BSR is
 * a CE and is treated in the same way as data, it may be lost. Please note that
 * the code substract the amount of bytes devoted to the SHORT_BSR from the
 * available ones, so there will always be a space to send it. The only
 * exception (theoretically possible) is when the status PDUs use all the
 * available space; in this case, a rework of the code will be needed.
 *
 * The SHORT_BSR is not reflecting the standard, but it is the same data that
 * was sent in LENA, indicating the status of 4 LCG at once with an 8-bit value.
 * Making this part standard-compliant is a good novice exercise.
 *
 * \section ue_mac_configuration Configuration
 *
 * The user can configure the class using the method NrHelper::SetUeMacAttribute(),
 * or by directly calling `SetAttribute` on the MAC pointer. The list of
 * attributes is reported below, in the Attributes section.
 *
 * \section ue_mac_traces CTRL-trace Traces for CTRL messages
 *
 * The class has two attributes that signals to the eventual listener the
 * transmission or the reception of CTRL messages. One is UeMacRxedCtrlMsgsTrace,
 * and the other is UeMacTxedCtrlMsgsTrace. For what regards the PHY, you will
 * find more information in the NrUePhy class documentation.
