 * \brief Interface between the physical layer and the channel
 *
 * \section spectrum_phy_general General information
 *
 * NrSpectrumPhy models some of the basic
 * physical layer functionalities such as transmitting CTRL or DATA,
 * receiving the signals, decoding them, and distinguishing whether the
 * signal is useful (CTRL, DATA), i.e. sent to this NR device NrPhy
 * instance, or it should be considered as interference. It
 * is also responsible for obtaining measurements, and for HARQ feedback
 * generation by leveraging HARQ module.
 *
 * This class implements the interface between the NrPhy
 * and the spectrum channel, and provides to NrPhy aforementioned
 * functionalities. Each NR device's NrPhy has its
 * own NrSpectrumPhy that is in charge of providing these basic
 * phy layer functionalities. In order to be able to receive signals from the channel,
 * each NrSpectrumPhy should be registered to listen events from its channel.
 * To achieve that, during the configuration of NR device's NrPhy
 * at some point should be called AddRx function of the spectrum channel
 * to register the NrSpectrumPhy instance as a receiver on that channel.
 *
 * This class also has the interface with NrInterference class to
 * pass the necessary information for the interference calculation and to
 * obtain the interference calculation results.
 *
 * Also it has interface with HARQ module, to which it passes necessary
 * information for the HARQ feedback generation, which is then forwarded
 * to NrPhy.
 *
 * \section spectrum_phy_configuration Configuration
 *
 * The user can configure the class using the method NrHelper::SetGnbSpectrumAttribute(),
 * or NrHelper::SetUeSpectrumAttribute(), depending on the type of user
 * you want to configure, or by directly calling `SetAttribute` on the pointer.
 * The list of  attributes is reported below, in the Attributes section.
